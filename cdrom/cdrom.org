#+TITLE: CDROM notes and info etc
#+AUTHOR: Ornyx (duh)

* Preface
Yeah so once again i'm reaching the complex parts of this project where i need
to make stupid notes in order to make sure that i can understand and write out
what i need to do.

* I/O Registers
Alright so the I/O Registers have different meanings based on the "Index"
So like based on the first bit of the index/status register the read and write
operations change etc so I need to implement that later
