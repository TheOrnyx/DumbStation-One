#+TITLE: general todo's and stuff
#+AUTHOR: Ornyx (again, duh)

* Things to research
** Pointer vs value
Basically need to research if storing values as pointers is fine or should you
use values, especially for long standing values
*** Constructors
Should a constructor return a value or a pointer to that instance
#+begin_src go
  type Foo struct{}

  func NewFooVal() Foo {
          return Foo{}
  }

  // vs

  func NewFooPointer() *Foo {
          return new(Foo)
  }
#+end_src
which of these is better 

*** Struct field
Is it better for like a struct having another instance as a field to store that
as a pointer or as a value
#+begin_src go
  type Foo struct{}

  type BarVal struct{
          foo Foo // as a value
  }

  type BarPoint struct {
          foo *Foo // as a pointer
  }
#+end_src

When these are allocated and shit which one is better, especially in the long run

** Is grouping into structs fine
basically I want to know if it's generally fine to store say for example 2
values into a struct for easier debugging and shit or if that causes more shit
to be allocated and what not.

* Things to maybe change
+ Maybe like instead of having the like instruction methods take in an
  instruction object just like have the cpu struct have a like
  "current_instruction" field or smth
+ Check whether or not it's better to return an error for like store32 or just
  to panic, cuz panic lets me see the stacktrace
+ Maybe switch around my instructions to like be instruction methods that take
  in a cpu or smth just cuz
+ Switch the instruction methods like targetReg to take the cpu and just return
  the REG value
+ Maybe switch the instruction chooser from a switch to a like array again or
  smth idk
+ Yeah definitely switch to an overall instruction type with a function pointer
  etc like in gameboy emulator
+ Make the like loads and stores be generic
+ Maybe shorten the names of some of my instruction methods
+ I mostly did it because i was following along but fix the god awful nextPC
  currentPC etc etc, it's gross
+ Make a function where the jump and branch instructions should set shit like
  currentPC etc just so i don't have to copy code a bunch
+ Maybe reduce some of the like logging feedback cuz it'll slow down shit
+ Redo some of my log debug things to inclidue the size jsut cuz it's easier
